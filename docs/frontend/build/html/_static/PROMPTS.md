! THIS PROMPT DID NOT WORK

I've update the javascript charting tool to deal with two plot types:

-   point_margin_v_win_percent

and

-   time_v_point_margin

Having made this update, I've change the structure of the json data slightly.  
Now, instead of point_margin_data it is y_values.

I want you to look at the json data and fix a few problems:

1.  Currently, for the plot type point_margin_v_win_percent -- the hover boxes
    come up but they do not contain any game data.

2.  For the plot_type == time_v_point_margin , there is no m, x, or r values. Instead,
    the trend line data should come from x_value, y_value_fit pairs.

│ > This is a project to create a sphinx RST formatter. Major goals are: │
│ _ Line break all lines at 88 characters but be sure to keep the level of indentation consistent. │
│ _ Put a sphinx ref before all headlines that ========= headlines so that header can be linked else in sphinx rst document projects. │
│ _ Spell check the document. │
│ _ Be written in python. │
│ │
│ Update the CLAUDE.md to reflect this. Also, make the basic folder structure of a standard open source project on github, which a docs folder and all collateral │
│ documents. Write the initial sphinx_formatter.py script that can be used in a tool like VSCode to auto format sphinx .rst files on save.

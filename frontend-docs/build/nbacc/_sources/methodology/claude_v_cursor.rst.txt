⏺ I've implemented the NBA Charts Calculator feature as requested. Here's what I've
added:

  1. Created three new files:
    - bacc_calculator_core.js - Core functionality with Num class for math
      operations and data processing
    - js/nbacc_calculator_ui.js - UI handling for the calculator lightbox
    - css/nbacc-calculator.css - Styling for the calculator UI
  2. Updated test_calculator.html with:
    - Added Bootstrap CSS and JS for better UI components
    - Added Math.js library for mathematical operations
    - Included our new calculator JavaScript and CSS files
  3. Key features implemented:
    - Press 'c' key to open calculator UI in a lightbox
    - Select from 4 plot types: "Max Points Down Or More", "Max Points Down", "Points Down At Time", "Percent Chance: Time
  Vs. Points Down"
    - Add multiple year ranges (1996-2024) with options for regular season and playoffs
    - Add multiple game filters with team selection and ranking filters
    - Interactive UI with Bootstrap styling

  The calculator will load season data from JSON files, process it according to
  selected filters, and then use the existing chart library to display the results.

Prompt: When the light box opens, the form is too high.  1. Create some white space
around at the top and bottom.  Also use more width if you can.
  Overall, the options need to be way tighter for what we are selecting.  Also, the
  remove button needs to be not red.

  Gave me this image

.. code::   > The the title for Year Groups should be Seasons.   There should not be a label 
    box.   The Regular Season and Playoff should both be checked by       │
   default.  When both are selected, the year_groups passed to the javascript should
   be [["{min_year}", "{max_year}"]].  When only regular season is    │ │   selected
   it should be [["R{min_year}", "{max_year}"]] when only playoffs is selected it
   should be [["P{min_year}", "{max_year}"]].  The 'Remove'     │ │   Button should
   only be on the 2nd or 3rd or 4th etc year groups.  We must have 1 year group.
   Also, the remove button needs to be further to the      │ │   right.

.. code::

    > Make the form wider.  Also, when I add a season, there is no remove box for the 2nd, 3rd season, etc.   Reduce the vertical padding so everything
    is tighter in the vertical dimension.

.. code::
    
    We need to specify the time under the plot type ranging from 48 minutes to 0 minutes.  Then, this will be sent to the function.                      │
    start_time={selected_value} stop_time={0 if plot type Max Points or Percent | null if Points Down At Time}

.. code::
    Make the time box be exactly the number 48, 36, 24, 18, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1      
    
.. code::
    Make the button Add Season be Add Season Range          

.. code::
    The Game Filters line should be For Team Instead of Home Team and Vs Team instead of Away team.  
    
.. code::
    The Teams in Top N should be For Team Rank and it should be selector like the Time or Min Year and be the values 'Top 5' 'Top 10' 'Mid 10' 'Bot 10'
   'Bot 5'.  Same for the Teams in Bottom N should be Vs Team Rank.

.. code::
    The Game Outcome should be 'For Team At' with a selector of 'Either' 'Home' 'Away' Everything should be on a single line with the For Team box to    │
    the right of the text For Team.  One line per game filter.  The remove button should be at the very right of the line.  Everything on one line.      │
    The default should be no game filter and you have to add a game filter.
